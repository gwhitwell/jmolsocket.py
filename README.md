# jmolsocket.py
This has a couple of classes to run Jmol (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/) in a python subprocess with socket communication between the Jmol instance and the python script.  Functions main() and demo() provide examples.  Class sndrcv() is for testing socket communication between 2 running python scripts.
TODO: get the python socket reader to accept arbitrary transmissions from Jmol
